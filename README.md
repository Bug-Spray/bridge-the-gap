# Bridge The Gap

This can serve as a starting point, give you some clues into Python, and in principle performs what you're after.

## Notes:

* It's trivial to break code into separate functions with `def` keyword. \
  I've started at the inside and worked outwards...
* The canonical way to launch a script is with `python3 file.py`, which starts Python and "runs" the `file.py` code.

## Tools:

* Install VSCode (Visual Studio Code), and any Python helpers it recommends.
    * It's free, and very comprehensive
    * You can clone this code repo to your PC machine in VSCode and get started changing things easily
